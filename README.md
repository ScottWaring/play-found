# play-found

Play, Found! Was created by the real need of parents on the go to be able to find playgrounds quickly and easily for their kids. 

User can also create reviews for playgrounds, add playground objects, and add bathroom objects.

Users can search by their current location, or by enter an address, the rendered results will include user created bathrooms and playgrounds
in addition to Google generated playground objects. As more users engage with the app and create more objects the result base will
grow and be more useful to other users. 

The frontend is built with React-Redux and the backend is Ruby On Rails.
